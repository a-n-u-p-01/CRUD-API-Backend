This is a simple API that performs CRUD operations for managing student data. I developed this to understand how a backend created with Spring Boot and connects to the frontend. The API supports operations to create, read, update, and delete student records, making it a practical example for learning full-stack development.

The frontend part of the application, which consumes this API, is available in the following repository: https://github.com/a-n-u-p-01/CURD-API-Frontend.

Features:
Create: Add new student records.
Read: Retrieve student details.
Update: Modify existing student records.
Delete: Remove student records.
Technologies Used:
Backend: Spring Boot
Frontend: React (located in the provided repository)
Database: MongoDB (or any database of your choice)
This project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of how a backend API interacts with a frontend application to perform essential CRUD operations in a student management system.
